## [7.0.5] - 2026-04-05

### 🧹 Removed

**Dead Code & Stale Files**
- Removed `docs/PROCESS_ARCHITECTURE.md` — described obsolete v6.0.0 4-phase architecture
- Removed `docs/STRATEGY_GUIDE.md` — described TOPSIS optimization removed in v7.0.0
- Removed 11 unused chart functions from `charts.py` (~1,000 lines):
  `create_equity_drawdown_chart`, `create_rolling_metrics_chart`, `create_correlation_heatmap`,
  `create_tier_sharpe_heatmap`, `create_risk_return_scatter`, `create_factor_radar`,
  `create_weight_evolution_chart`, `create_signal_heatmap`, `create_bar_chart`,

- Removed unused `import plotly.graph_objects as go` from `app.py`

### ✨ Added

**Enhanced Terminal Logging**

- Added detailed checkpoints for every critical step in Phase 1 and Phase 2
- Per-run unique Run ID generated on each "Run Analysis" click (previously session-scoped)
- Signal Distribution card counts now based on raw conviction scores instead of fragile string parsing

**Position Guide Tab**
- Moved Position Guide section from Portfolio tab into dedicated tab
- Added signal distribution summary with conviction breakdown metrics

**Market Regime Auto-Detection**

### 🐛 Fixed

- Investment style selector default index always evaluated to 1 (SIP) — now correctly defaults to 0 (Swing Trading)
- Signal Distribution card counts misclassified positions due to emoji-prefixed signal strings

---

## [7.0.4] - 2026-04-02

### ✨ Added

**Style-Aware Conviction Dispersion**

Different dispersion profiles for SIP vs Swing Trading investment styles:

| Style | Boost | Penalty | Top Pick Advantage | Use Case |
|-------|-------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| **SIP Investment** | +125% (×2.25) | -50% (×0.50) | ~350% more weight | Long-term wealth building |
| **Swing Trading** | +225% (×3.25) | -75% (×0.25) | ~1200% more weight | Active trading, alpha capture |

**Formula:**
```python
# Auto-selected based on investment_style parameter

# SIP Mode (conservative concentration)
if score > median:
    adjusted = score × 2.25  # +125% boost
else:
    adjusted = score × 0.50  # -50% penalty

# Swing Mode (aggressive, 2σ more concentration)
if score > median:
    adjusted = score × 3.25  # +225% boost
else:
    adjusted = score × 0.25  # -75% penalty

weight = (adjusted / Σ all_adjusted) × 100
```

**Effect:**
- SIP: Strong concentration with moderate risk (~350% tilt to top picks)
- Swing: Maximum concentration in best ideas (~1200% tilt) for alpha capture
- Both maintain 30-position diversification with 1-10% bounds

### 🔧 Changed

- `portfolio.py::compute_conviction_based_weights()` now accepts `investment_style` parameter
- Dispersion auto-selects based on style when `dispersion_params=None`

---

## [7.0.3] - 2026-04-02

### 🔧 Changed

**Aggressive Conviction Dispersion**

Maximum concentration in high-conviction picks:
- Symbols with conviction **above median**: **+75% boost** (was +40%)
- Symbols with conviction **at/below median**: **-50% penalty** (was -30%)

**Formula:**
```python
median = median(all_conviction_scores)

if score > median:
    adjusted = score × 1.75  # +75% boost
else:
    adjusted = score × 0.50  # -50% penalty

weight = (adjusted / Σ all_adjusted) × 100
```

**Effect:**
- High-conviction symbols receive ~250% more weight vs linear allocation
- Aggressive concentration in best ideas while maintaining 30-position diversification
- Configurable via `dispersion_params` tuple in `portfolio.py`

---

## [7.0.2] - 2026-04-02

### 🔧 Changed

**Increased Conviction Dispersion**

Stronger concentration in high-conviction picks:
- Symbols with conviction **above median**: **+40% boost** (was +15%)
- Symbols with conviction **at/below median**: **-30% penalty** (was -10%)

**Formula:**
```python
median = median(all_conviction_scores)

if score > median:
    adjusted = score × 1.40  # +40% boost
else:
    adjusted = score × 0.70  # -30% penalty

weight = (adjusted / Σ all_adjusted) × 100
```

**Effect:**
- High-conviction symbols receive ~100% more weight vs linear allocation
- Strong concentration in best ideas while maintaining 30-position diversification
- Configurable via `dispersion_params` tuple in `portfolio.py`

---

## [7.0.1] - 2026-04-02

### ✨ Added

**Conviction Dispersion Weighting**

To concentrate capital in high-conviction picks:
- Symbols with conviction **above median**: **+15% boost**
- Symbols with conviction **at/below median**: **-10% penalty**

**Formula:**
```python
median = median(all_conviction_scores)

if score > median:
    adjusted = score × 1.15  # Boost
else:
    adjusted = score × 0.90  # Penalty

weight = (adjusted / Σ all_adjusted) × 100
```

**Effect:**
- High-conviction symbols receive ~28% more weight vs linear allocation
- Maintains diversification (still 30 positions)
- Preserves bounds (1% min, 10% max)

### 🔧 Changed

- `portfolio.py::compute_conviction_based_weights()` now has `apply_dispersion` parameter (default: `True`)
- Version bumped to 7.0.1 across all files

---

## [7.0.0] - 2026-04-02

### 🎯 Major Changes

**Complete system refactoring to implement pure conviction-based portfolio curation.**

### ✨ Added

- Top 30 positions selected by conviction score (0-100 range)
- Position bounds: 1% minimum, 10% maximum per position
